      This tools have been developed as installable addin for Autodesk Revit 2015 up to Revit 2019. They have been developed during some ongoing projects with hope that  processes would be eased by enabling tiny steps which might, in full project length, spare some time and make overall workflow less painfull. They have been made for internal use and purpose of this website is to make sharing easier and to make that version control is always up to date. At the bottom of this page there is a download link for executable file which makes installation process really easy.

    <h2>Delete multiple parameters from family editor</h2>
    <p>
      One of the also tiresome processes when dealing with Revit is removal of multiple family parameters from Revit family. Regular workflow is to select parameter, click remove and then confirm that parameter should be deleted. If there are more parameters which need to be removed, these few steps need to be repeated. In order to avoid this, our tiny Revit help tool enables user to select as many parameters required and remove them with single button click.
